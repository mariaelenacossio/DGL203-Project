      <!-- ***********************  DETAILS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT  *********************** -->

      <section class="content-wrap projects">
        <h3>Development Details</h3>
        <p>
            This project will be developed in Tailwind CSS due to its main feature of this library, 
            unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes 
            for elements such as buttons or tables. 
            Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element 
            by mixing and matching which it will allow me to focus on the usability and design of the site.
